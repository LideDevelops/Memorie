# Memorie Game
This is a simple game of memorie (work in progress). 

## Intention 
This project is a playground for me to test new technologies. I want to improve my coding skills as a full stack developer by utilizing some modern tools and techniques. This might result in an over engineered solution just to make sure I test it properly.

## Planned objectives to learn 

- [ ] React frontend to play game of memory
- [ ] SignalR to communicate with frontend and backend to enable a game between two clients
- [ ] Postgress SQL DB persistance instance to store a saved gamne state
- [ ] OData2 + OpenID Connect model for user authorization and authentication
- [ ] Redis as temporary data persistance while game is running (regulary push the state down to DB so that persistance is fast as well as permanent)
- [ ] ...

## Want to play it?
I am afraid at the moment the game is not done. I am not sure yet if it will ever be hosted somewhere. Howeever you are free to host it yourself and run it. Modify it for your need however you want it. I don't care if you put advertisement on it or not. Feel free to use however you want. However keep in mind that I am not providing assistance nor am I taking resposebility for the this code when it is not hosted and managed by me. So if you use the software by yourself it is your and only your responsibility to maintain and keep safe.
